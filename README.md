# React Shopping Cart Application

This project is a shopping cart application built with React based on Typescript and Redux to state management. It allows users to add products to a cart, view the list of selected products, and maintain the cart state internally.

## Features

1. **Product Listing**: The application displays a list of products that can be added to the cart. (The product list is simulated in the frontend).
2. **Add to Cart**: Users can add products from the list to the cart.
3. **View Cart**: The cart displays the total number of items, and by clicking (or always visible), the selected items and their quantities from the list are shown.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
